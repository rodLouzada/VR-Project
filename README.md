# FEAR OF HEIGHTS

Virtual reality is a powerful tool in exposure therapy. Patients are immersed in situations or have stimuli that are related to their phobias, and over
time, and under the guidance of a medical professional they may become less sensitive to that stimuli.

In this assignment we aim to develop an environment to help users deal with fear of heights. 

The user starts at the bottom of a mountain. And the first task to start the game is to enter an elevator and lift up to the first platform. 

The mountain has several platforms, as many as selected by therapist. Each platform may have one and up to three tables with tasks that the user has to complete to be able to proceed to the next platform. 

The level is completely customizable by the therapist. In which can select the number of platforms, the types of platforms, and tasks to perform in each level. 

To summarize, the user will be incrementally challenged to face and overcome its fears by playing this game.
